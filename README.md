#ECRotationDemo
This repository holds the sample code that accompanies my [blog post](http://clstroud.com/blog/granular-auto-rotation-control-in-ios-6/) highlighting how to handle granular rotation in view controllers in iOS 6.

This code should also be backwards compatible with at least iOS 5, if not also iOS 4, however I don't have the iOS 5 simulator installed at the time of this writing.
